## Logo Designs

### Prompt 1A: The Secure Shield

> Minimalist logo design for 'LibreFolio', a self-hosted financial tracking application. The icon should combine the concept of a secure vault or shield with financial growth. A
> stylized, solid dark forest green shield shape contains an upward-trending line graph or arrow rendered in a contrasting mint green color. Below the icon, the word 'LibreFolio' is
> written in a clean, modern, dark forest green sans-serif font. The background is a clean, solid cream off-white. The overall feeling should be trustworthy, professional, private,
> and open-source. Flat design.

### Prompt 1B: The Smart Ledger

> Minimalist logo design for 'LibreFolio'. The icon is a stylized open book or financial ledger viewed from above, rendered in solid dark forest green. The 'lines' on the
> right-hand page of the book are not straight text but instead form an upward-curving financial bar chart or growth graph, rendered in a contrasting mint green color, indicating
> knowledge leading to growth. Below the icon, the word 'LibreFolio' is written in a clean, modern, dark forest green sans-serif font. The background is a clean, solid cream
> off-white. Flat design, professional and smart.

> the shield is a stylized monogram letter 'L' (for LibreFolio) combined with an upward-pointing arrow, rendered in a contrasting mint green color, symbolizing protected growth.
> Below the shield icon, the word 'LibreFolio' is written in a clean, modern, dark forest green sans-serif font. The background is a clean, solid cream off-white. Flat design, strong

> Transactions, and Settings. The main content area features three large summary cards at the top with rounded corners: 'Total Net Worth €125,450.00' (with a small mint green upward
> arrow and +2.4%), 'Weighted ROI 8.2%', and 'Available Cash €5,300'. Below the cards, a large, clean line chart showing portfolio growth over the last 6 months with a soft green
> gradient fill. To the right of the line chart, a donut chart showing asset allocation (e.g., Stocks 50%, ETFs 30%, P2P Loans 20%).

> €125,450.00' total balance with a smaller green '+2.4% Today' indicator underneath. Below this, a scrollable list of asset summary cards with rounded corners: 'VWCE ETF' showing a

> navigation bar with white icons for Home, Portfolio, and a central '+' button for adding transactions.
