# Broker Access Control (RBAC)

LibreFolio implements a granular **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system for Brokers. This allows users to share access to their brokerage accounts with other users (e.g., family members, accountants) while maintaining control over permissions.

## Overview

Access is managed via the `BrokerUserAccess` table, which links a `User` to a `Broker` with a specific `UserRole`.

    USER ||--o{ BROKER_USER_ACCESS : "has access"
    BROKER ||--o{ BROKER_USER_ACCESS : "granted to"
    
    BROKER_USER_ACCESS {
        int user_id FK
        int broker_id FK
        enum role "OWNER, EDITOR, VIEWER"
    }
```

## Roles and Permissions

There are three roles with increasing levels of privilege:

| Feature | VIEWER | EDITOR | OWNER |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **View Broker Details** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **View Transactions** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **View Reports/Charts** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Add/Edit Transactions** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Import Files (BRIM)** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Edit Broker Settings** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Manage Access (Add/Remove Users)** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Delete Broker** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

### Role Definitions

1.  **VIEWER**: Read-only access. Ideal for sharing portfolio visibility without risk of data modification.
2.  **EDITOR**: Operational access. Can manage the day-to-day data (transactions, imports) and broker settings (name, icon), but cannot perform destructive administrative actions (deleting the broker) or change who has access.
3.  **OWNER**: Administrative access. Full control over the broker.

## Key Rules & Constraints

### The "Last Owner" Rule
To prevent brokers from becoming "orphaned" (inaccessible by anyone with admin rights), the system enforces a strict rule:

> **The last OWNER of a broker cannot be removed or downgraded.**

If a broker has only one user with the `OWNER` role:
-   That user **cannot** remove themselves.
-   That user **cannot** change their role to `EDITOR` or `VIEWER`.
-   To leave the broker, they must first promote another user to `OWNER` or delete the broker entirely.

### Self-Management
-   **Leaving**: Any user (except the last OWNER) can remove *themselves* from a broker at any time.
-   **Downgrading**: Users cannot change their own role (except to leave). Only an OWNER can change roles.

## Implementation Details

The logic is centralized in `backend/app/services/broker_service.py`.

-   **`_check_user_access(broker_id, user_id, min_role)`**: Core internal method to verify permissions.
-   **`add_access()`**: Grants access to a new user (OWNER only).
-   **`update_access()`**: Changes an existing user's role (OWNER only).
-   **`remove_access()`**: Revokes access (OWNER can remove anyone; others can only remove themselves).

### API Endpoints

Access management is exposed via the following endpoints:

-   `GET /api/v1/brokers/{id}/access`: List all users with access.
-   `POST /api/v1/brokers/{id}/access`: Grant access.
-   `PATCH /api/v1/brokers/{id}/access/{user_id}`: Change role.
-   `DELETE /api/v1/brokers/{id}/access/{user_id}`: Revoke access.
