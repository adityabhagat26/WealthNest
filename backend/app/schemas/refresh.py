"""
Refresh & Sync Operation Schemas (FA + FX).

This module consolidates refresh/sync operations for both Financial Assets (FA)
and Foreign Exchange (FX) systems. These are operational workflows that fetch
and update price/rate data from external providers.

**Naming Conventions**:
- FA prefix: Financial Assets refresh operations
- FX prefix: Foreign Exchange sync operations

**Domain Coverage**:
- FA Refresh: Fetch and store asset prices from providers (yfinance, etc.)
- FX Sync: Fetch and store FX rates from central banks (ECB, FED, etc.)

**Design Notes**:
- Consolidation rationale: Both operations perform similar "fetch-and-store" workflows
- Kept separate sections (FA Refresh / FX Sync) for semantic clarity
- No backward compatibility maintained during refactoring
- All models use Pydantic v2 with strict validation

**Structure Differences**:
- FA Refresh: 3-level (Item → Bulk → Result per asset)
- FX Sync: 2-level (Request with params → Response with summary)
  - FX sync operates on date ranges + currency lists (no per-pair config)
  - FA refresh operates on asset-by-asset basis with provider-specific params
