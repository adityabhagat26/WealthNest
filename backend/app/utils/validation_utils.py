    """
    Validate compound frequency based on compounding type.

    Ensures that:
    - COMPOUND compounding requires a frequency value (e.g., daily=365, monthly=12)
    - SIMPLE compounding must NOT have a frequency (it's meaningless for simple interest)

    Args:
        compounding: Compounding type ("COMPOUND" or "SIMPLE")
        compound_frequency: Frequency value (e.g., 365 for daily, 12 for monthly, 1 for annual)
        field_name: Name of the frequency field (for error messages)

    Raises:
        ValueError: If COMPOUND has no frequency, or SIMPLE has a frequency

    Examples:
        >>> validate_compound_frequency("COMPOUND", 12)  # OK (monthly compounding)
        >>> validate_compound_frequency("SIMPLE", None)  # OK (simple interest)
        >>> validate_compound_frequency("COMPOUND", None)  # ValueError
        >>> validate_compound_frequency("SIMPLE", 365)  # ValueError

    Note:
        Use this in FAInterestRatePeriod and FALateInterestConfig @model_validator
        to ensure scheduled investment configurations are logically consistent.
